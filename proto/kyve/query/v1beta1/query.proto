   This query-module servers all queries for the following (KYVE-)modules:
   bundles, pool, delegation, stakers

   As a lot of request require composition of multiple module-data
   everything will be served from one single query module.

   The named packages do not implement their own queries (expect for params)

   For simplicity all queries and their objects are in the corresponding
   proto files

   Messages that are used for across multiple queries are defined here.
