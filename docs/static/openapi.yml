                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: address
          description: |-

            pagination defines an optional pagination for the request.

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                              type of the serialized

                              protocol buffer message. This string must contain
                              at least

                              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                              path must represent

                              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should
                              be in a canonical form

                              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                              In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                              binary all types that they

                              expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                              for URLs which use the

                              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                              optionally set up a type

                              server that maps type URLs to message definitions
                              as follows:


                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                              [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                              based on the
                                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                breaking changes.)

                              Note: this functionality is not currently
                              available in the official

                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                              implementations and no plans to implement one.


                              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                              scheme) might be

                              used with implementation specific semantics.

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                                A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                                type of the serialized

                                protocol buffer message. This string must
                                contain at least

                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                                path must represent

                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name
                                should be in a canonical form

                                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                                binary all types that they

                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                                for URLs which use the

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                                optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message
                                definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                                [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup
                                results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                                Note: this functionality is not currently
                                available in the official

                                protobuf release, and it is not used for type
                                URLs beginning with

                                type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are

                        Validator defines a validator, together with the total

                        Validator's bond shares and their exchange rate to
                        coins. Slashing results in

                        a decrease in the exchange rate, allowing correct
                        calculation of future

                        undelegations without iterating over delegators. When
                        coins are delegated to

                        this validator, the validator is credited with a
                        delegation whose number of

                        bond shares is based on the amount of coins delegated
                        divided by the current

                        exchange rate. Voting power can be calculated as total

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                                A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                                type of the serialized

                                protocol buffer message. This string must
                                contain at least

                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                                path must represent

                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name
                                should be in a canonical form

                                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                                binary all types that they

                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                                for URLs which use the

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                                optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message
                                definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                                [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup
                                results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.

                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                                A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                                type of the serialized

                                protocol buffer message. This string must
                                contain at least

                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                                path must represent

                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name
                                should be in a canonical form

                                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                                binary all types that they

                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                                for URLs which use the

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                                optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message
                                definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                                [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup
                                results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                                Note: this functionality is not currently

                        a decrease in the exchange rate, allowing correct
                        calculation of future

                        coins are delegated to

                        this validator, the validator is credited with a
                        delegation whose number of

                        bond shares is based on the amount of coins delegated
                        divided by the current

                        exchange rate. Voting power can be calculated as total

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                      used type server

                      implementations and no plans to implement one.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }
                      // or ...
                      if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".


                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {

                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                        message along with a

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".


                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the

                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                        message along with a

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;

                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }
                            // or ...
                            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".


                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        on the

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: pagination.key
          description: |-
            key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin

            UIs.

            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored
            when key

            is set.

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;

                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {

                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                               if err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                          default use

                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL
                          and the unpack

                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after
                          the last '/'

                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                          yield type

                          name "y.z".


                          JSON

                          ====

                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                          regular

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                          with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                          Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                          custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded
                          adding a field

                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                          `@type`

                          field. Example (for message
                          [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no
                            widely used type server

                            implementations and no plans to implement one.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {

                            }

                            {

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's

                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                                for URLs which use the

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                                optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message
                                definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                                [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup
                                results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);

                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                          of the serialized

                          least

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no

                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                          scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;

                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }
                            // or ...

                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".


                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        Foo foo = ...;

                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            }
                            // or ...
                            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".


                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                            implementations and no plans to implement one.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }
                            // or ...
                            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".


                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no
                            widely used type server

                            implementations and no plans to implement one.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }
                            // or ...
                            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".


                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            follows:

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                            implementations and no plans to implement one.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message
                        [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

        TallyResult returns the tally result of a proposal. If the proposal is

        still in voting period, then this query computes the current tally
        state,

        which might not be final. On the other hand, if the proposal is final,

        then it simply returns the `final_tally_result` state stored in the

        proposal itself.

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                              In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                              expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                              for URLs which use the

                              as follows:


                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                              based on the

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                          message along with a

                          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                          values in the form

                          of utility functions or additional generated methods
                          of the Any type.


                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any;
                              any.PackFrom(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }
                              // or ...
                              if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                               if err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                          default use

                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL
                          and the unpack

                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after
                          the last '/'

                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                          yield type

                          name "y.z".


                          JSON

                          ====

                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                          regular

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                          with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                          Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                          custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded
                          adding a field

                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                          `@type`

                          field. Example (for message
                          [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                            "firstName": <string>,
                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                            "value": "1.212s"

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".


                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                description: >-
                  Normally the RevisionHeight is incremented at each height
                  while keeping

                  RevisionNumber the same. However some consensus algorithms may
                  choose to

                  reset the height in certain conditions e.g. hard forks,
                  state-machine

                  breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is
                  incremented so that

                  height continues to be monitonically increasing even as the

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {

                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".


                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                  Normally the RevisionHeight is incremented at each height

                  choose to

                  state-machine

                  breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any

                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()

                        ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {

                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely
                        used type server

                        implementations and no plans to implement one.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }
                        // or ...
                        if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".


                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
