## Reporting a Vulnerability

Two main ways of reporting a vulnerability to the KYVE Core Team exist.

You can contact us at security@kyve.network, which all code owners can access and check regularly. Tied to this email, you can find our [public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security@kyve.network) that you can use to send us encrypted emails.

Additionally, you can go through GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting system](https://github.com/KYVENetwork/chain/security/advisories/new).
